In school days' embrace, we learned and grew,
With friends by our side, and skies so blue.
Chalk dust in the air, laughter in the halls,
Teachers who inspired, answered every call.

Homework and tests, the challenges we'd face,
Yet memories of those times, we'd never erase.
Innocence and wonder, in those youthful ways,
Oh, the magic of school days, in a golden haze.
